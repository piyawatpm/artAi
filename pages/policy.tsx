          ArtsAi is an online AI-based website application that offers a unique
          feature for creating digital art by transforming text/prompts or user
          sketches into polished and refined artwork. The AI algorithms analyze
          the user's input and generate a new piece of art with added details,
          textures, and elements. Additionally, ArtsAi also offers the ability
          to animate static drawings, bringing characters and illustrations to
          life with motion and action. This combination of AI sketch to art and
          drawing to animation provides a comprehensive solution for creating
          dynamic and visually stunning digital art.
